- name: Deploy IT Tooling Stack

  # This playbook deploys a containerised instance of Dozzle, Beszel, and IT Tools
  # It is intended to be run on the 'dozzle' host group defined in the Ansible inventory
  # The playbook includes tasks to deploy each service, pulling the necessary Docker images
  # and configuring them with appropriate labels, ports, and volumes.
  # The playbook also includes a task to load homelab variables from a YAML file
  # to ensure that the services are configured correctly for the homelab environment.
  # The playbook is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing issues
  # if the services are already deployed or if the configuration has not changed
  # It is recommended to run this playbook on a host with Docker installed and configured
  # to ensure that the services can be deployed successfully.
  # The playbook is structured to allow for easy modification and extension in the future
  # if additional services need to be added or if the configuration of existing services needs to change
  # The playbook is also designed to be compatible with the Ansible Galaxy role structure
  # allowing for easy integration with other roles and playbooks in the homelab environment.
  # The playbook is intended to be run as part of a larger homelab deployment
  # and is not intended to be run in isolation.
  # It is recommended to run this playbook as part of a larger homelab deployment
  # that includes other services such as Traefik, Portainer, and Uptime Kuma
  # to ensure that the services can be accessed and managed effectively.
  # The playbook is designed to be run on a host with sufficient resources
  # to support the deployment of multiple containerised services
  # and is intended to be run on a host with a stable network connection
  # to ensure that the services can be accessed and managed effectively.
  # The playbook is designed to be run on a host with a modern version of Docker
  # installed and configured, as it relies on Docker to deploy the services.
